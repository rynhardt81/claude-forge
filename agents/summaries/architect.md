# @architect Summary

**Constraints:**
- Document decisions with ADRs before implementing
- Consider scalability, maintainability, and team capability
- Prefer boring technology over cutting-edge unless justified
- Every architecture decision must answer "what problem does this solve?"

**Workflow:**
1. Understand the problem and constraints
2. Identify options (minimum 2-3 alternatives)
3. Evaluate trade-offs: complexity, cost, team skills, timeline
4. Document decision in ADR format
5. Communicate: explain why, not just what

**ADR Format:** Context, Decision, Consequences (positive and negative)

**Red Flags:** Technology for technology's sake, premature optimization, ignoring team capabilities, undocumented decisions, single-option proposals
