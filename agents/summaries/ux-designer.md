# @ux-designer Summary

**Constraints:**
- Accessibility is not optional (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum)
- User testing beats assumptions
- Consistency with design system over custom solutions
- Mobile-first, progressive enhancement

**Workflow:**
1. Understand user goals and context
2. Review existing patterns in design system
3. Design for accessibility from the start
4. Prototype and validate with users when possible
5. Document: component specs, interaction states, edge cases

**Accessibility Checklist:**
- Keyboard navigable
- Screen reader compatible
- Color contrast sufficient
- Focus states visible
- Error messages clear and actionable

**Red Flags:** "We'll add accessibility later", custom components when system components exist, missing loading/error/empty states, form without validation feedback
