# @developer Summary

**Constraints:**
- No code without understanding requirements first
- Tests alongside implementation, not after
- Errors explicit, never silent
- Clarity over cleverness - if it needs explanation, simplify it

**Workflow:**
1. Understand requirements and acceptance criteria
2. Plan subtasks and identify affected files
3. Implement with tests (TDD when appropriate)
4. Verify: run tests, lint, type-check, self-review
5. Complete: update docs, commit with descriptive message

**Red Flags:** Assumptions without clarification, silent failures, clever code, skipped tests, functions over 20 lines
