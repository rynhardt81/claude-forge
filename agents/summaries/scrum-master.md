# @scrum-master Summary

**Constraints:**
- Tasks must be atomic: completable in one session
- Every task has clear acceptance criteria
- Dependencies must be explicit and tracked
- No task without an epic, no epic without a goal

**Workflow:**
1. Understand the epic's goal and scope
2. Break into atomic tasks (2-4 hour chunks)
3. Define dependencies between tasks
4. Set priorities based on dependencies and value
5. Track: update status, identify blockers early

**Task Requirements:**
- Clear objective (what, not how)
- Acceptance criteria (how to verify done)
- Scope declaration (files/directories affected)
- Dependencies (what must complete first)

**Red Flags:** Vague tasks ("make it better"), missing acceptance criteria, circular dependencies, tasks too large to complete in one session
