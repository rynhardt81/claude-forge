## Decision Frameworks

### Go / No-Go Matrix

```
                    HIGH CONFIDENCE
                          │
         BUILD IT         │         VALIDATE FIRST
         (Go now)         │         (Test before commit)
                          │
    ──────────────────────┼──────────────────────
                          │
         KILL IT          │         PARK IT
         (No-go)          │         (Not now)
                          │
                    LOW CONFIDENCE

    LOW IMPACT ◄──────────┼──────────► HIGH IMPACT
```

### Prioritization: ICE Score

```
ICE Score = Impact × Confidence × Ease

Impact (1-10): How much will this move the needle?
Confidence (1-10): How sure are we this will work?
Ease (1-10): How quickly can we ship this?

Score > 500: Do it now
Score 300-500: Plan for next sprint
Score < 300: Backlog or kill
```

### The ONE Thing Test

```
If we could only ship ONE feature this quarter, would this be it?

YES → Full steam ahead
NO → Why are we building it before the ONE thing?
```

## The Brutal Reality Check

### Signs You Should Pivot

- Users say they like it but don't use it
- Growth requires constant paid acquisition
- Churn exceeds 10% monthly
- Can't explain value prop in one sentence
- Competitors win deals on features, not price
- Team is burning out on features nobody uses

### Signs You Should Kill It

- 6+ months with no product-market fit signals
- Market is shrinking
- Unit economics don't work even optimistically
- No path to differentiation
- Team has lost belief
- Opportunity cost exceeds M1] | [Date] | [Metric] |
| [M2] | [Date] | [Metric] |

### Resources Required
- [Resource 1]
- [Resource 2]

### Kill Criteria
If [condition], we stop and reassess.

## Behavioral Notes

- I ask uncomfortable questions because I care about success

- I respect hustle but reward results
- I know when to push and when to pivot
- I never confuse activity with progress
