## Build Autonomous AI Applications with Structured Workflows

Claude Forge is a **comprehensive framework for AI-assisted software development** with Claude Code. It enables structured, safe, autonomous development through task management, intelligent dispatch, and reusable skills.

### 30-Second Overview

- **Autonomous development** from requirements to deployment
- **Task management** with dependencies for parallel work
- **Intelligent dispatch** for automatic sub-agent parallelization
- **Project memory** for persistent institutional knowledge
- **Hook enforcement** for mandatory security gates
- **15 specialized agents** for different roles (developer, architect, PM, etc.)

## Why Claude Forge?

Claude Forge solves a critical problem: **keeping AI development structured, safe, and scalable**. Whether you're building new projects or enhancing existing codebases, Claude Forge provides the guardrails and patterns for reliable autonomous development.

### The Problem

Without structure, AI development becomes chaotic:

- Lost context between sessions
- Duplicate work or conflicting changes
- No visibility into progress or decisions
- Difficulty coordinating parallel work
- Security and validation gaps

### The Claude Forge Solution

#### 1. Intelligent Dispatch System

- Automatically parallelize work without conflicts
- Analyzes task dependencies to find independent work clusters
- Spawns multiple sub-agents to work in parallel
- Detects and prevents scope conflicts (no race conditions)
- Saves 50%+ development time for independent features

**Use Case:** Working on authentication AND dashboard AND payment features simultaneously—all managed automatically.

#### 2. Project Memory

- Never lose institutional knowledge again
- Persistent storage of bug patterns, design decisions, code patterns, and key facts
- Full-text searchable archive
- Automatically integrated into new sessions
- Survives session breaks without context loss

**Use Case:** "Why did we choose Postgres?" → Instantly find the decision record and rationale.

#### 3. Epic/Task Management with Dependencies

- Structure large projects reliably
- Organize work into epics and atomic tasks
- Declare explicit dependencies between tasks
- Automatic task state management (pending → ready → in_progress → completed)
- Lock management prevents concurrent modifications
- Supports parallel work on independent tasks

**Use Case:** Feature A depends on API refactoring (Task 1). While Task 1 runs, work continues on parallel Feature B.

#### 4. 15 Specialized Agents

The right person for every role:

- Developer - Code implementation
- Architect - System design and ADRs
- Project Manager - Requirements and scope
- Security Boss - Auth, payments, security
- Quality Engineer - Testing and verification
- DevOps - CI/CD, deployment
- Performance Enhancer - Profiling and optimization
- ...and 8 more specialized roles

Route work to the perfect agent: `@architect explain this design decision`

#### 5. Reusable Skills

Workflows that actually work:

- `/new-project` - Full project initialization with PRD, architecture, tasks
- `/reflect resume` - Seamless session continuation with full context
- `/new-feature` - Add features with PRD, tests, and deployment
- `/fix-bug` - Debug with integrated knowledge base
- `/refactor` - Restructure code safely
- `/create-pr` - Generate polished pull requests
- `/pdf` - Document processing and manipulation
- ...more specialized workflows

#### 6. Hook Enforcement

- Mandatory security gates (not just suggestions)
- Blocks code writes without active session/task registry
- Prevents modifications to protected files (.env, .git/)
- Enforces command allowlists
- Saves context before compaction
- Non-negotiable project rules

### Real-World Impact

**Before Claude Forge:**

```
Session 1: Build auth module        → Lost context when session ends
Session 2: "Where did we stop?"     → Re-read all files, duplicate work
Session 3: Payment feature          → Conflicts with in-progress refactoring
Session 4: "Why is this pattern?"   → No decision history
```

**With Claude Forge:**

```
Session 1: /new-project "E-commerce platform"
  → PRD, ADRs, tasks created automatically
  → 3 agents dispatched in parallel

Session 2: /reflect resume
  → Full context restored
  → Only changed files reloaded
  → Ready to continue where you left off

Session 3: /reflect status --dispatch
  → Shows which tasks can run in parallel
  → No conflicts, full coordination

Session 4: /remember search "why postgres"
  → Instantly find the decision and rationale
```

---

## Quick Start

### New Project

Start a brand new project with Claude Forge:

```bash
# 1. Create your project directory
mkdir my-new-project && cd my-new-project

# 2. Clone Claude Forge as your .claude directory
git clone https://github.com/rynhardt81/claude-forge.git .claude
rm -rf .claude/.git

# 3. Start Claude Code and initialize
claude
```

Then run in Claude Code:
```
/new-project "My awesome e-commerce app"
```

The `/new-project` command runs a **continuous workflow**:

| Phase | What Happens | Output |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| 0 | Framework setup | `.claude/` structure, CLAUDE.md, memories |
| 1 | Requirements discovery | `docs/prd.md` |
| 2 | Architecture & standards | ADRs, populated reference docs |
| 3 | Task planning | `docs/epics/`, `docs/tasks/registry.json` |

After initialization, start working:
```
/reflect status --ready   # See available tasks
/reflect resume T001      # Start first task
```

---

### Existing Project (No Previous Claude Config)

Add Claude Forge to an existing codebase that doesn't have a `.claude` directory:

```bash
# 1. Navigate to your project
cd /path/to/existing-project

# 2. Clone Claude Forge as .claude
git clone https://github.com/rynhardt81/claude-forge.git .claude
rm -rf .claude/.git

# 3. Start Claude Code
claude
```

Then run in Claude Code:
```
/new-project --current
```

The `--current` flag analyzes your existing codebase:
- **Discovers** your tech stack from package.json, requirements.txt, etc.
- **Identifies** project structure, existing commands, and patterns
- **Presents findings** for your confirmation before proceeding
- **Creates** PRD, architecture docs, and task breakdown based on existing code

---

### Existing Project (Migrating from Previous Claude Config)

If your project already has a `.claude` directory with previous configuration:

**Option 1: Using Migration Script (Recommended)**

```bash
# 1. Clone Claude Forge to any location
git clone https://github.com/rynhardt81/claude-forge.git
cd claude-forge

# 2. Run the migration script
./scripts/migrate.sh              # macOS/Linux
# or
.\scripts\migrate.ps1             # Windows PowerShell

# 3. Follow prompts - enter your project path
# The script will:
#   - Backup your existing .claude/ to .claude_old/
#   - Install Claude Forge to your project's .claude/
#   - Create a restoration script for rollback

# 4. Start Claude Code in your project
cd /path/to/your-project
claude
```

Then run in Claude Code:
```
/migrate
```

The `/migrate` skill:
- Merges your old configuration (memories, settings, project docs)
- Runs brownfield analysis to fill documentation gaps
- Creates missing PRD, ADRs, and task registry
- Preserves your project history

**Option 2: Manual Migration**

```bash
cd /path/to/existing-project
mv .claude .claude_old
git clone https://github.com/rynhardt81/claude-forge.git .claude
rm -rf .claude/.git
claude
# Then run: /migrate
```

---

### Autonomous Development

For full autonomous implementation from idea to code:

```
/new-project "E-commerce platform for handmade crafts" --autonomous
```

This runs Phases 0-5:
- Phases 0-3: Same as standard (PRD, ADRs, tasks)
- Phase 4: MCP server setup, security model
- Phase 5: Kickoff with `/implement-features`

Combine with existing project:
```
/new-project --current --autonomous
```

---

### Minimal Setup

Framework setup only (skip documentation):

```
/new-project --minimal
```

---

## Task Management

### Epic/Task Structure

Projects are organized into **epics** (major feature areas) containing **atomic tasks**:

```
docs/
├── tasks/
│   ├── registry.json          # Master task/epic registry
│   └── config.json            # Project configuration
└── epics/
    ├── E01-authentication/
    │   ├── E01-authentication.md   # Epic file
    │   └── tasks/
    │       ├── T001-setup-auth.md  # Task files
    │       ├── T002-login-form.md
    │       └── T003-session-mgmt.md
    └── E02-dashboard/
        └── ...
```

### Task States

| Status | Description | When |
|--------|-------------|------|
| `pending` | Dependencies not met | Task waiting for other tasks |
| `ready` | Can be started | All dependencies complete |
| `in_progress` | Being worked on | Agent has acquired lock |
| `continuation` | Partially complete | Session ended mid-task |
| `completed` | Done | Task finished and verified |

### State Flow

```
pending → ready → in_progress → completed
                       ↓
                  continuation
                       ↓
                  in_progress → completed
```

### Dependencies

**Task-Level:** T002 depends on T001
```json
{
  "id": "T002",
  "dependencies": ["T001"]
}
```

**Epic-Level:** E02 depends on E01
```json
{
  "id": "E02",
  "dependencies": ["E01"]
}
```

**Cross-Epic:** T010 (E02) depends on T003 (E01)
```json
{
  "id": "T010",
  "epic": "E02",
  "dependencies": ["T003"]
}
```

### Parallel Work

Multiple agents can work on independent tasks simultaneously:

```
Terminal 1: /reflect resume T001  # Authentication setup
Terminal 2: /reflect resume T010  # Dashboard layout (no deps on T001)
Terminal 3: /reflect resume T020  # API integration (no deps on T001, T010)
```

The registry tracks locks to prevent conflicts. Default max: 3 parallel agents.

### Lock Management

Tasks are locked when an agent starts work:

```bash
/reflect status --locked   # See all locked tasks
/reflect unlock T002       # Force unlock stale task
```

**Lock timeout:** 1 hour (configurable)

## Intelligent Dispatch

The framework includes an **Intelligent Dispatch System** that automatically parallelizes work and detects user intent.

### Sub-Agent Dispatch

Automatically analyzes task dependencies and spawns parallel agents for independent work:

- **At Resume** - Analyzes registry for parallelizable tasks
- **After Task Completion** - Re-analyzes to find newly unblocked tasks
- **After Feature Completion** - Checks for parallelizable features

**Task Registry Dispatch:**
1. Gets all `ready` tasks (dependencies met, not locked)
2. Builds dependency graph to find independent clusters
3. Checks scope conflicts (overlapping files/directories)
4. Spawns sub-agents with isolated scope and context

**Feature Database Dispatch:**
- Different categories can often parallelize
- Same-category features run sequentially (shared files)
- Critical categories (A: Security, P: Payment) never parallelize

### Intent Detection

Detects natural language patterns and suggests appropriate skills:

| Pattern | Suggested Skill |
|---------|-----------------|
| "add feature", "implement", "build" | `/new-feature` |
| "fix bug", "debug", "broken" | `/fix-bug` |
| "refactor", "clean up", "restructure" | `/refactor` |
| "create pr", "pull request" | `/create-pr` |
| "continue", "resume", "pick up where" | `/reflect resume` |
| "design", "think through", "explore" | `brainstorming` |

**Rules:**
- Only suggests when confidence ≥ 0.7
- Always suggests, never auto-invokes (user must confirm)
- Respects explicit commands (if user types `/skill`, skip detection)

### Dispatch Configuration

Location: `.claude/memories/.dispatch-config.json`

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `dispatch.enabled` | true | Enable automatic sub-agent dispatch |
| `dispatch.mode` | "automatic" | "automatic" or "confirm" before spawning |
| `dispatch.maxParallelAgents` | 3 | Max concurrent sub-agents |
| `intentDetection.enabled` | true | Enable natural language skill detection |
| `intentDetection.mode` | "suggest" | "suggest" (always) or "off" |
| `intentDetection.confidenceThreshold` | 0.7 | Minimum confidence to suggest skill |

**Presets:**
| Preset | Description | Settings |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| `careful` | New projects | confirm mode, 2 agents, 0.8 threshold |
| `balanced` | Normal use | automatic mode, 3 agents, 0.7 threshold |
| `aggressive` | Large projects | automatic mode, 5 agents, 0.6 threshold |

Apply with: `/reflect config --preset balanced`

---

## Project Memory

The **Project Memory** system captures institutional knowledge that persists across sessions, preventing "AI project amnesia" where valuable context is lost between conversations.

### Memory Categories

| Category | File | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| **Bugs** | `docs/project-memory/bugs.md` | Bug patterns, root causes, and solutions |
| **Decisions** | `docs/project-memory/decisions.md` | Technical decisions with rationale |
| **Key Facts** | `docs/project-memory/key-facts.md` | Important project facts |
| **Patterns** | `docs/project-memory/patterns.md` | Reusable code patterns |

### How It Works

1. **Recording Memories** - Use `/remember <category> "description"` to capture knowledge
2. **ToC-Based Loading** - Each file has a table of contents for token-efficient scanning
3. **Smart Loading** - `/reflect resume` loads relevant memories based on task context
4. **Bug Integration** - `/fix-bug` automatically checks bugs.md before diagnosis
5. **Full-Text Search** - SQLite FTS5 archive enables searching across all memories

### Usage Examples

```bash
# After fixing a tricky bug
/remember bug "Async test failures were caused by missing await on database cleanup"

# After a technical decision
/remember decision "Chose Postgres over SQLite for production due to concurrent writes"

# Recording key facts
/remember fact "max_connections: 100 (load balanced across 3 DB replicas)"

# Recording patterns
/remember pattern "Use the retry decorator for all external API calls"

# Searching memories
/remember search "database connection"
```

### Adding to Existing Projects

For projects that already have Claude Forge installed:

```bash
# macOS/Linux
./scripts/add-project-memory.sh

# Windows PowerShell
.\scripts\add-project-memory.ps1
```

These scripts:
- Create `docs/project-memory/` with template files
- Install the `/remember` skill
- Update `/fix-bug` and `/reflect` with memory integration
- Create timestamped backups before overwriting existing files

### What /new-project Does

The `/new-project` command automatically:
1. Creates `.claude/CLAUDE.md` with your project details
2. Initializes memory structure with session tracking
3. Copies reference templates
4. Creates PRD through requirements discovery
5. Creates ADRs through architecture planning
6. Creates epic/task structure for development

### Manual Setup (Alternative)

If you prefer manual setup:

**Create CLAUDE.md:**
```bash
cp .claude/templates/CLAUDE.template.md .claude/CLAUDE.md
# Then edit .claude/CLAUDE.md with your project details
```

**Initialize memories:**
```bash
mkdir -p .claude/memories/sessions/active
mkdir -p .claude/memories/sessions/completed
echo "No previous session recorded." > .claude/memories/sessions/latest.md
echo "# General Memories" > .claude/memories/general.md
echo "# Progress Notes" > .claude/memories/progress-notes.md
```

**Copy reference templates:**
```bash
cd .claude/reference/
for f in *.template.md; do
  cp "$f" "${f%.template.md}.md"
done
```

## Framework Components

### Skills

| Skill | Command | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| Reflect | `/reflect` | Capture session state and learnings |
| Resume | `/reflect resume` | Load previous session context |
| Status | `/reflect status` | View task/epic status |
| New Project | `/new-project` | Initialize project |
| Migrate | `/migrate` | Migrate existing project to Claude Forge |
| Implement | `/implement-features` | Autonomous feature loop |
| Remember | `/remember` | Project memory management |
| PDF | `/pdf <command>` | PDF processing tasks |

### Agents

Agents are invoked with `@agent-name: [task]`. They are NOT automatic - you must route work to them.

| Agent | Role | When to Use |
|-------|------|-------------|
| @security-boss | Security | Auth, payments, security-sensitive code |
| @architect | System design | Architecture decisions, ADRs |
| @project-manager | Planning | PRDs, scope, requirements |
| @scrum-master | Sprint management | Task breakdown, tracking |
| @quality-engineer | Testing | Test strategy, verification |
| @developer | Implementation | Writing code (default) |
| @analyst | Requirements discovery | User research, problem analysis |
| @devops | Infrastructure | CI/CD, Docker, K8s, deployment |
| @performance-enhancer | Performance | Profiling, optimization |
| @api-tester | API testing | Load testing, API contracts |
| @ux-designer | UX/UI design | User flows, wireframes |
| @visual-mistro | Visuals | Diagrams, charts, architecture visuals |
| @whimsy | Micro-interactions | Animations, delightful touches |
| @ceo | Strategy | Go/no-go decisions, prioritization |
| @orchestrator | Workflow coordination | Unsure which agent to use |

### Templates

| Template | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `prd.md` | Product Requirements Document |
| `epic-minimal.md` | Epic with task list and dependencies |
| `task.md` | Task with continuation context |
| `task-registry.json` | Master task/epic registry |
| `config.json` | Project configuration |
| `adr-template.md` | Architecture Decision Record |

---

## Configuration

### View Configuration

```bash
/reflect config
```

### Update Settings

```bash
/reflect config lockTimeout 1800        # 30 minute lock timeout
/reflect config maxParallelAgents 5     # Allow 5 concurrent workers
/reflect config autoAssignNextTask false
```

### Configuration Options

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `lockTimeout` | 3600 | Seconds before lock is stale |
| `allowManualUnlock` | true | Allow /reflect unlock |
| `maxParallelAgents` | 3 | Max concurrent task locks |
| `autoAssignNextTask` | true | Auto-suggest next task |
| `maxContextTokens` | 200000 | Total context budget |
| `targetResumeTokens` | 8000 | Target for resume context |
| `dispatch.enabled` | true | Enable automatic sub-agent dispatch |
| `dispatch.mode` | "automatic" | "automatic" or "confirm" before spawning |
| `intentDetection.enabled` | true | Enable natural language skill detection |
| `intentDetection.mode` | "suggest" | "suggest" (always) or "off" |
| `intentDetection.confidenceThreshold` | 0.7 | Minimum confidence to suggest skill |

## Customization

### What to Customize

| Item | Action | Location |
|------|--------|----------|
| CLAUDE.md | **Required** - Add project details | `.claude/CLAUDE.md` |
| Reference docs | **Recommended** - Fill architecture | `.claude/reference/` |
| Config | **Optional** - Adjust settings | `docs/tasks/config.json` |

### What NOT to Modify

| Item | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `templates/` | Framework templates |
| `skills/` (core files) | Framework workflows |
| `00-documentation-governance.md` | Universal rules |

---

## Troubleshooting

### Tasks not showing as ready

**Check:** Are dependencies complete?
```bash
/reflect status
```

**Fix:** Complete dependent tasks first, or check for circular dependencies.

### Lock stuck on task

**Check:** Is the lock stale?
```bash
/reflect status --locked
```

**Fix:** Force unlock:
```bash
/reflect unlock T002
```

### Session not resuming

**Check:** Do memory files exist?
```bash
ls -la .claude/memories/sessions/
```

**Fix:** Create the files:
```bash
mkdir -p .claude/memories/sessions
echo "No previous session." > .claude/memories/sessions/latest.md
```

### Claude doesn't see the framework

**Check:** Is `.claude/` in your project root?
```bash
ls -la .claude/CLAUDE.md
```

### Hooks not enforcing gates

**Check:** Is `settings.json` configured?
```bash
ls -la .claude/settings.json
```

**Fix:** Install hooks:
```bash
chmod +x .claude/hooks/*.sh
cp .claude/templates/settings.json .claude/settings.json
```

**Verify:** Test gate-check (should exit with code 2):
```bash
echo '{"tool_input":{"file_path":"test.js"}}' | bash .claude/hooks/gate-check.sh
```

### Task registry not found

**Check:** Did you run `/new-project`?
```bash
ls docs/tasks/registry.json
```

**Fix:** Run `/new-project` or create manually from template.
